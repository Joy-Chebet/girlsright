This programme works with governments, civil society organizations, networks of religious leaders, parliamentarians, youth and human rights activists, and academia to:<br><br>Support the development of policies and legislation, and ensure adequate resources, to end FGM;<br>Amplify interventions that expand collective knowledge about the harms of FGM and empower champions for its elimination;<br>Support gender equality and girls’ and women’s rights;<br>Empower young people to end FGM in their communities;<br>Address the trend of medicalization by galvanizing health professionals to view FGM as a human rights violation;<br>Integrate FGM responses into sexual and reproductive health, maternal and child health, and child protection services – areas that offer entry points for identifying and supporting girls and women who are at risk or have been subjected to FGM.<br>Mainstream FGM into health training programmes, mobilize doctors, nurses and midwives in support of FGM prevention and care, and empower health providers to serve as role models, counsellors and advocates in the effort to end FGM; and<br>Establish a global knowledge hub for the measurement and dissemination of social norms and good practices captured by the Joint Programme for policy-making and improved programming.<br>The Joint Programme recognizes that eliminating FGM requires communities to make a collective and coordinated choice so that no single girl or family is disadvantaged by the decision.<br>This approach has seen progress. Civil society organizations are implementing community-led education and dialogue sessions on human rights and health. These networks are helping a growing number of communities declare their abandonment of FGM. A shift has occurred among religious leaders, many of whom have gone from endorsing the practice to actively condemning it. There has been a growing number of public declarations de-linking FGM from religion and supporting of abandonment of the practice.<br><br>With UNFPA technical guidance and support, there has been a surge in activities to strengthen the role of public health services in preventing FGM and, wherever possible, in treating its victims and mitigating its negative effects on women’s health. Health workers have been trained to treat complications caused by FGM, including the integration of FGM care into medical education curriculum.<br><br>Referral systems that build coordination between health providers and community actors and organizations have also been strengthened.<br><br>Several countries have passed new national legislation banning FGM and developed national policies with concrete steps to achieve the abandonment of FGM. Radio networks have aired call-in shows about the harm caused by FGM. The use of media to galvanize public opinion against the practice has helped change perceptions and transformed public perceptions of girls who remain uncut.<br><br></p>

Cited health benefits include “a lower risk of vaginal cancer … fewer infections from microbes gathering under the hood of the clitoris, and protection against herpes and genital ulcers.”<br><br>Moreover, at least two studies by Western scientists have shown a negative correlation between female circumcision and HIV. The authors of one of the studies, both seasoned statisticians who expected to find the opposite relationship, described their findings as a “significant and perplexing inverse association between reported female circumcision and HIV seropositivity.”<br><br>None of these findings is conclusive. I am not saying that female “circumcision” can ward off HIV or any other disease. But let us just imagine that some of the above-cited health benefits are eventually confirmed. Would anti-FGM campaigners suddenly be prepared to say that female genital cutting was ethically acceptable?<br><br></p>

More than 200 million girls and women alive today have been cut in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia where FGM is concentrated. [1] An extreme form of gender discrimination, it is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women: including the right to health, security and physical integrity and the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.<br><br>FGM has no health benefits and causes only harm. Women and girls who are subjected to FGM are at risk of both short- and long-term negative health consequences – including for their physical, sexual, mental, and social well-being.<br><br>The direct financial cost of treating the negative health complications caused by FGM can span generations, starting as early as childbirth. This puts a significant economic burden on health systems and national budgets, especially in countries with rates of FGM greater than 10%.<br><br>Until now, there have been limited data on the financial costs associated with FGM, making it hard to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of programmes and policies that can prevent FGM by 2030 – a global priority in the Sustainable Development Agenda. The new WHO Cost Calculator now provides an economic argument which can be used by those advocating for an end to FGM.</p>
