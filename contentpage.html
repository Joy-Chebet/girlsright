It aims to ensure premarital virginity and marital fidelity. <br>Where it is believed that FGM increases marriageability, it is more likely to be carried out.<br>FGM is associated with cultural ideals of femininity and modesty, which include the notion that girls are clean and beautiful after removal of body parts that are considered unclean, unfeminine or male.<br>Some people believe that the practice has religious support, although no religious scripts prescribe the practice.<br>Religious leaders take varying positions with regard to FGM: some promote it, some consider it irrelevant to religion, and others contribute to its elimination.<br>Local structures of power and authority, such as community leaders, religious leaders, circumcisers, and even some medical personnel can contribute to upholding the practice. Likewise, when informed, they can be effective advocates for abandonment of FGM.<br>In most societies, where FGM is practised, it is considered a cultural tradition, which is often used as an argument for its continuation.</p>

It involves removing and damaging healthy and normal female genital tissue, and interferes with the natural functions of girls' and women's bodies. Although all forms of FGM are associated with increased risk of health complications, the risk is greater with more severe forms of FGM.<br><br>Immediate complications of FGM can include:<br><br>severe pain<br>excessive bleeding (haemorrhage)<br>genital tissue swelling<br>fever<br>infections e.g., tetanus<br>urinary problems<br>wound healing problems<br>injury to surrounding genital tissue<br>shock<br>death.<br>Long-term complications can include:<br><br>urinary problems (painful urination, urinary tract infections);<br>vaginal problems (discharge, itching, bacterial vaginosis and other infections);<br>menstrual problems (painful menstruations, difficulty in passing menstrual blood, etc.);<br>scar tissue and keloid;<br>sexual problems (pain during intercourse, decreased satisfaction, etc.);<br>increased risk of childbirth complications (difficult delivery, excessive bleeding, caesarean section, need to resuscitate the baby, etc.) and newborn deaths;<br>need for later surgeries: for example, the sealing or narrowing of the vaginal opening (Type 3) may lead to the practice of cutting open the sealed vagina later to allow for sexual intercourse and childbirth (deinfibulation2). Sometimes genital tissue is stitched again several times, including after childbirth, hence the woman goes through repeated opening and closing procedures, further increasing both immediate and long-term risks;<br>psychological problems (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, low self-esteem, etc.);<br></p>

Civil society organizations are implementing community-led education and dialogue sessions on human rights and health. These networks are helping a growing number of communities declare their abandonment of FGM. A shift has occurred among religious leaders, many of whom have gone from endorsing the practice to actively condemning it. There has been a growing number of public declarations de-linking FGM from religion and supporting of abandonment of the practice.<br><br>With UNFPA technical guidance and support, there has been a surge in activities to strengthen the role of public health services in preventing FGM and, wherever possible, in treating its victims and mitigating its negative effects on women’s health. Health workers have been trained to treat complications caused by FGM, including the integration of FGM care into medical education curriculum.<br><br>Referral systems that build coordination between health providers and community actors and organizations have also been strengthened.<br><br>Several countries have passed new national legislation banning FGM and developed national policies with concrete steps to achieve the abandonment of FGM. Radio networks have aired call-in shows about the harm caused by FGM. The use of media to galvanize public opinion against the practice has helped change perceptions and transformed public perceptions of girls who remain uncut.</p>
